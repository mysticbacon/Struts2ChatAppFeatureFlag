# Struts2ChatAppFeatureFlag

This is a Struts 2 application demonstrating how to use feature flags using [Unlaunch Java SDK](https://docs.unlaunch.io/docs/sdks/java-sdk). In this example, when the feature flag is turned on, the new UI is shown to users. When the feature flag is turned off, the old UI is displayed.

To run the app,

`mvn jetty:run`
